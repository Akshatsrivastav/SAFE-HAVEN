		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<p align="justify">As we all know that the world is in grave danger, losing companions from the animal kingdom is a huge loss to the human species. No living being is superior to another, and thereby, adopting an animal is as important as adopting an abandoned human child.
Welcome to Safe Haven! Thanks for stopping by.

We are a group of animal lovers and caretakers. Our prime purpose is to bring abandoned animals into households by providing a portal for the same.  But we won't stop there. We also offer valuable information on the human-animal relationship to help keep the voiceless beings healthy in their caring homes forever. We also use the power of the social media to connect shelter pets with adopters and help pets go from being helpless to adopted. 

Our services (previously offerings):- 
Seamlessly connect with potential animal adopters.
Report animal cruelty online (with an option to stay anonymous) providing essential data points such as location, photographs and other supporting information.
An elaborate directory of vet doctors, animal vaccine centers, etc.
To increase public awareness of the abuse of animals in our society</p>
